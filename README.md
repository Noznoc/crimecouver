# Visualization of Crime Data in Vancouver

To learn react, I decided to visualize the [City of Vancouver's crime data](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) (2003-2016) using Mapbox GL JS and react. Code closely follows [Mapbox's react examples](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-react-examples).

### Download

    git clone git@github.com:Noznoc/crimecouver.git

### Install

On the command line, go to the directory crimecouver is located in

    cd crimecouver

Then enter the following to install dependencies and to run the app

    npm install
    npm start

Then make sure to run `http://localhost:3000/` from your browser

    open http://localhost:3000/
